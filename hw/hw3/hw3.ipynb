    "## Problem 7. Causality vs. correlation (10 points)\n",
    "An important part of data science is understanding the relationships between data.  **Correlation** is the degree to which data change with one another.  **Causality** implies a direct relationship where changes in one thing directly results in changes to another thing.  Data can be correlated without any causality relationship; in fact, this occurs often when the data both depend on a third variable.  For example, number of shark attacks and ice cream sales are often correlated, but one does not cause the other; they both depend on weather conditions.  "
