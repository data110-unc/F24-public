To do this, every person in lab will (one at a time) reach into the bag of candy with one hand and grab a handful of candy.  They'll call out what they hauled in, and everyone will record it in a data table in JupyterHub.  To be thorough, you'll record the number of **Starbursts**, number of **Kisses**, and number of **Miniatures**.  We won't record any info about the person, and to be considered a valid \"handful\" sample, at least 1 candy must be pulled out.  \n",
