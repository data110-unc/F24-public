    "This week, we discussed how to use `seaborn` to visualize table data. As mentioned in the beginning, `seaborn` is a powerful tool that can get us very beautiful plots easily, but it can also be difficut to customize plots to 100% our liking. That's why today we are going over some important `matplotlib` functions and parameters that can be used in conjunction with `seaborn`."
